This is a list of things that should be done.
Help is welcome!

- Set parameters like NLS_DATE_FORMAT *after* the Oracle connection has been
  established.  Otherwise, an ill-guided Oracle logon trigger could mess up
  our NLS settings.
- Map PostgreSQL type "json" (and maybe "jsonb") to Oracle VARCHAR2 and CLOB.
